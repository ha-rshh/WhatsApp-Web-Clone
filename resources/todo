- Add Form Validation in LogIn and SIgnUp Forms

- When user signs up, create and object and store in local storage as an array of objects

- When user logs in  then weâ€™ll check on the array of object in local storage and validate it.

- If we find a user in that array of objects then we will create a currentUser.

- When the page initially loads, then we will check if there exists a currentUser

- if not then we will redirect to the login page
otherwise we will use the currentUser

- otherwise we will use the currentUser
